Lo & Sons makes and sells travel bags. From initial look, the vendor uses Shopify.

I'm assuming the link above (which is part of the head in the html) relates to the CSS stylesheet from Shopify which works as a foundation. Vendors/Customers have to make further modifications to this foundation in order to get the site looking the way they want.

The html seems to be well organized in the beginning. I see various notes that separate out different sections such as Google Tag Manager, Sentry IO, and Theme. However, as we get to the latter half of the html which contains header and body, it becomes hard to read and understand. There are multiple divs that do not seem to be structured to be digested. I made certain modifications that make the html easier to read. The lesson I get from this is that you need to keep the structure of the html consistent for efficiency. If it is not organized and structured in a way that is easily digestable, it will take longer to troubleshoot or make further modifications in the html. I also think it is important that if you are working as a team to create an html, the team needs to agree on a certain structure or format, so that the html looks consistent.
